# NextPage

## Application Overview
NextPage aims to provide fresh new book recommendations for its audience. Users can filter by genre and search specific titles to find literature that suits their particular interests. To get started, NextPage will ask the user to create an account. This will be used to store the genres the user like most. From the recommendations page, books can then be filtered by the user's favorite genres.

## Architecture Overview
  We will use HTML to develop the structure and primary content of the website. This includes the home page (which pulls the top ten books from the database), the recommendations page, the userâ€™s account page, and more. Then, we will use CSS to format and stylize each of the webpages. In order to animate features of our website, such as button clicks and pop-ups, we will use JavaScript. Each of these are front-end technologies. 

  On the server side, we will use Node.js to create the server the website will be hosted on and render each of the pages. Registered users and books will be stored in two databases, each made accessible by integrating PostgreSQL into Node.js.

The application will be accessible on localhost.
